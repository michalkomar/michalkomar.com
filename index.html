            <p>I don't know why you're here. Maybe you clicked on a link, maybe you Googled my name, or maybe you're just curious. Whatever the reason, <strong>the only thing that matters is how I can entertain you or add value.</strong></p>

        <section class="about">
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I'm an AI Consultant at <a href="https://www.jtbank.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J&T Banka</a> (former Head of Digital Experience), where I lead the transformation of banking through artificial intelligence and digital innovation. My work sits at the intersection of product strategy, AI implementation, and organizational change in financial services.</p>
            <p>Banking is at a critical inflection point. Traditional institutions are being disrupted not just by fintech startups, but by fundamentally different customer expectations shaped by AI-native experiences. My role is to bridge this gap - bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities into an established banking environment while maintaining the trust and reliability that financial services demand.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="projects">
            <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
            <p><strong>Shift AI:</strong> An AI-driven platform designed to accelerate digital transformation across banking operations. This initiative focuses on intelligent automation, predictive analytics, and machine learning models that enhance decision-making processes for both customers and internal teams.</p>
            <p><strong>Agent Lab:</strong> An experimental environment for developing and testing AI agents in controlled banking scenarios. This lab serves as a proving ground for autonomous systems that can handle complex financial tasks, from customer service to compliance monitoring, before they're deployed in production environments.</p>
            <p><strong>Supervisor Hub:</strong> A centralized oversight system that monitors AI agent performance, ensures regulatory compliance, and provides human operators with tools to intervene when needed. This project addresses one of banking's biggest AI challenges: maintaining accountability and control while leveraging autonomous systems.</p>
            <p>These projects are part of a broader digital transformation at J&T Banka, <a href="https://www.thetrask.com/blog/from-vision-to-a-next-gen-app-how-j-t-bank-rebooted-its-digital-channels-in-just-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documented in industry case studies</a>, where we rebuilt our digital channels from the ground up. The result is a <a href="https://www.ackee.agency/references/jtbanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next-generation banking platform</a> that processes over 2 million messages daily, consolidating data from 17 backend systems into a seamless user experience.</p>

        <section class="philosophy">
            <h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
            <p>I believe the future of banking isn't about replacing humans with AI - it's about augmenting human capabilities with intelligent systems that handle complexity at scale. The best products emerge when you deeply understand both the technology and the problem domain, then build solutions that feel obvious in retrospect.</p>
            <p>My approach combines three principles: <strong>Start with the customer problem</strong>, not the technology solution. Build systems that are transparent and explainable, especially in regulated environments. And move fast, but with appropriate safeguards - innovation in banking requires both speed and responsibility.</p>
            <p>I've learned as much from failures as from successes. The projects that didn't work taught me about organizational dynamics, the importance of stakeholder alignment, and the dangers of building technology without understanding the operational context. The wins came when we aligned incentives, moved iteratively, and focused relentlessly on measurable outcomes.</p>
            <p>What excites me most about this moment in banking is the convergence of several trends: large language models reaching production-ready maturity, regulatory frameworks beginning to adapt to AI systems, and customer expectations shifting toward AI-native experiences. We're at a rare inflection point where the technology, regulation, and market demand are all moving in the same direction.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
            <p>I post on <a href="https://x.com/michalkomar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a> about AI, product strategy, and occasionally other things that catch my attention.</p>
            <p>I live somewhere interesting, probably building something. I'm tall enough, curious enough, and <em>definitely</em> opinionated enough to have perspectives on most topics.</p>

        <section class="contact">
            <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
            <p>If you're working on interesting problems at the intersection of AI and finance, thinking about digital transformation in banking, or just want to discuss product strategy, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalkomar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let's talk</a>.</p>
            <p>I'm particularly interested in conversations about: agentic AI in regulated environments, building AI-native products, organizational change in traditional institutions, and the second-order effects of AI on banking business models.</p>
