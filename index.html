        <section class="about">
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I'm an AI Consultant at <a href="https://www.jtbank.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J&T Banka</a> (former Head of Digital Experience), where I lead the transformation of banking through artificial intelligence and digital innovation. I've helped build systems that process over 2 million messages daily, consolidating data from 17 backend systems.</p>
            <p>My work sits at the intersection of product strategy, AI implementation, and organizational change in financial services. I focus on deploying AI solutions in production environments, from intelligent automation to agentic systems that operate in regulated banking contexts.</p>
            <p>Banking is at a critical inflection point. Traditional institutions face disruption not just from fintech startups, but from fundamentally different customer expectations shaped by AI-native experiences. My role is to bridge this gap - bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities into an established banking environment while maintaining the trust and reliability that financial services demand.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="work">
            <h2>Key Focus Areas</h2>
            <p><strong>AI-Driven Automation:</strong> Building intelligent automation platforms that streamline banking operations, from customer service to document processing. These systems leverage machine learning and predictive analytics to enhance decision-making for both customers and internal teams.</p>
            <p><strong>Agentic AI Systems:</strong> Developing and deploying autonomous AI agents in regulated banking environments. This involves creating testing frameworks, oversight mechanisms, and production systems that handle complex financial tasks while maintaining compliance and accountability.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Platform Transformation:</strong> Leading initiatives that modernize banking infrastructure. This work includes <a href="https://www.thetrask.com/blog/from-vision-to-a-next-gen-app-how-j-t-bank-rebooted-its-digital-channels-in-just-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuilding digital channels from the ground up</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.ackee.agency/references/jtbanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next-generation banking platforms</a> that process over 2 million messages daily across 17 backend systems.</p>

        <section class="philosophy">
            <h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
            <p>I believe the future of banking isn't about replacing humans with AI - it's about augmenting human capabilities with intelligent systems that handle complexity at scale. The best products emerge when you deeply understand both the technology and the problem domain, then build solutions that feel obvious in retrospect.</p>
            <p>My approach combines three principles: <strong>Start with the customer problem</strong>, not the technology solution. Build systems that are transparent and explainable, especially in regulated environments. And move fast, but with appropriate safeguards - innovation in banking requires both speed and responsibility.</p>
            <p>I've learned as much from failures as from successes. The projects that didn't work taught me about organizational dynamics, the importance of stakeholder alignment, and the dangers of building technology without understanding the operational context. The wins came when we aligned incentives, moved iteratively, and focused relentlessly on measurable outcomes.</p>
            <p>What excites me most about this moment in banking is the convergence of several trends: large language models reaching production-ready maturity, regulatory frameworks beginning to adapt to AI systems, and customer expectations shifting toward AI-native experiences. We're at a rare inflection point where the technology, regulation, and market demand are all moving in the same direction.</p>
