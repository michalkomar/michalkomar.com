            <p>I don't know why you're here. Maybe you clicked on a link, maybe you Googled my name, or maybe you're just curious. Whatever the reason, <strong>the only thing that matters is how I can entertain you or add value.</strong></p>

            <h2>How I Can Entertain You</h2>
            <p>I post on <a href="https://x.com/michalkomar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a>.</p>
            <p>I live somewhere interesting, probably building something.</p>
            <p>I'm tall enough, curious enough, and <em>definitely</em> opinionated enough.</p>

        <section class="value">
            <h2>How I Can Add Value</h2>
            <p>I build things. Products, teams, systems - whatever needs building.</p>
            <p>I've had wins, I've had failures, and I've learned from both.</p>
            <p>If you think we should work together, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalkomar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let's talk</a>.</p>
